This plugin causes all trailing whitespace and tab characters to be
highlighted in red.

To fix the whitespace errors, just call :FixWhitespace. This removes all
trailing whitespace and replaces all tabs with spaces. It uses :retab to
replace the tabs with spaces, so expandtab should be set. By default it
operates on the entire file. Pass a range (or use V to select some lines)
to restrict the portion of the file that gets fixed.
